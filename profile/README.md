SciJava is a collection of foundational software libraries, upon which [ImageJ2](https://imagej.net/software/imagej2) and [Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji) are built.
It is a collaboration of projects providing software for scientific computingâ€”an effort to cooperate and reuse code.

* This organization is an [architectural layer](https://imagej.net/develop/architecture#organizational-structure) housing Java library components more general than imaging.
* Along with [imglib](https://github.com/imglib), it is a foundational layer of [imagej](https://github.com/imagej), [scifio](https://github.com/scifio), and [fiji](https://github.com/fiji).
* The SciJava Bill of Materials cataloguing the SciJava component collection is [scijava/pom-scijava](https://github.com/scijava/pom-scijava).
* The primary foundational library is [scijava/scijava-common](https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common).
* For the next incarnation of SciJava, the primary repository will be [scijava/scijava](https://github.com/scijava/scijava).
* See also the [SciJava project website](https://scijava.org/) and [SciJava page of the ImageJ wiki](https://imagej.net/libs/scijava).
